Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic game where players take turns placing their "X" or "O" marks on a grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
This version of the game is primarily implemented using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
It features a player-versus-computer mode, score persistence using Local Storage, responsiveness, and the ability to reset the game layout without losing the points. Additionally,
the starting player and the marker can be changed dynamically.

Instructions:
1. Open the index.html file in a modern web browser.
2.Click on an empty cell on the grid to place your mark. The computer will automatically take its turn.
3.The goal of the game is to get three of your marks ("X" or "O") in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4.If a player wins, the game ends, and a message indicating the winner will appear on the screen. The computer starts the next round, and the markers are switched.
5.Use the "Again" button to reset the game layout, keeping the accumulated points.
6.Use the "Reset" button to completely reset the game, including the points stored in Local Storage.
